3.3 We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our Site. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve you and our community. This information is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), what browser you are using, and your IP address.<br>

3.4 We use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of our Site. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services. We also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use "cookies" to allow you to enter login details less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our Site. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our Site and you may be required to re-enter your login details more frequently during a session.<br>

3.5 Additionally, you may encounter "cookies" or other similar devices on certain pages of our Site that are placed by third parties. For example, if you view a web page created by a user, there may be a "cookie" placed within that web page. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties.<br>

3.9 If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on the Site, we may collect such information in a file specific to you.

</p>
<h4>4. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h4><p>

4.1 We use personal information about you (including but not limited to the information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site) to facilitate safe trading on the Site, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use agreement. We may look at multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes and in particular we may peruse your information to identify users using multiple identities. We may also share your information with any related entities or affiliates, trading associates and joint venture partners to help coordinate the services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, prevent fraud and promote trust and safety and allow Stud & Found and these related entities and affiliates to provide better customer service to joint customers. By accepting this Privacy Policy you are consenting to the transfer of your personal information to the entities described in this section in accordance with this Privacy Policy.<br>

4.2 You agree that we may use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze site usage, to improve our content and product offerings and customize our Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve our Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safer and customized experience while using our services.<br>

4.3 You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of the Site. By accepting the Terms of Use and the Privacy Policy you expressly agree to receive this information.

</p>
<h4>5. DISCLOSURE OF YOUR INFORMATION BY US</h4><p>

5.1 Although Stud & Found uses industry standard practices to protect your personal information, due to technical limitations, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we cannot and do not guarantee, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.<br>

5.2 As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personal information about you to any third party. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed, and by agreeing to the Terms of Use including the Privacy Policy, you expressly agree that your personal information may be disclosed by Stud & Found in the following ways: Advertisers. We can aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we would not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, would never be disclosed to advertisers. Throughout the Site, you are identified by your first and last name. This offers transparency in trading with members. As a result, other users and third parties might send you unsolicited messages and emails and be able to personally identify all of your activities on the Site. Other people can see some of your dealings, your rating and associated comments, your postings on the Site, and so on. External Service Providers. There may be a number of services offered by external service providers that help you use our Site (e.g., co-branded sites, authentication services, mediation facilities). If you choose to use such optional services, disclose personal information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect personal information about you, then their use of your personal information is governed by their privacy policy. We may, for your convenience, provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services. However, before we disclose your personal information to an external service provider, you will have the opportunity to see what data is about to be sent and have the ability to approve the disclosure. To prevent our disclosure of your personal information to an external service provider, you can simply not use their services. Because we do not control the privacy practices of these third parties, you should evaluate their practices before deciding to use their services. Internal Service Providers. We may use internal service providers to facilitate our services (e.g., search, discussion boards, surveys) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to them. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you (such as the situation where we ask an internal service provider to conduct a survey for us). In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all information disclosures you make will be strictly optional. In all cases, these internal service providers' use of information we supply them is restricted by confidentiality agreements. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with other entities committed to serving your online trading needs and related services, throughout the world, as allowed by applicable law. It is possible that Stud & Found could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should such an event occur, you should expect that Stud & Found would share some or all of your information in order to continue to provide the service. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that the new entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy. Legal Requests for Information. Stud & Found may lawfully disclose your personal information for law enforcement or regulatory purposes. Stud & Found cooperates with law enforcement enquires and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other governmental officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, piracy or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

</p>
<h4>6. USING EMAIL TOOLS</h4><p>

6.1 You may not use any email forwarding services that we offer to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms of Use agreement or Privacy Policy. If you forward an email through our services we do nothing other than send the email. We do not rent or sell these email addresses. We do not permanently store the email messages or the email addresses.

</p>
<h4>7. ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4><p>

7.1 In “My Account” you must promptly update your personal information if it changes. Once posted, you cannot change or remove any public postings made in our message areas or the ratings area.<br>

7.2 Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, and financial information from our active databases. We will retain in our files information you have requested us to remove in some circumstances, such as to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, and enforce our Terms of Use agreement, and to comply with legal requirements. Furthermore, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such information will be deactivated from public viewing and usage by other members of Stud & Found and will only be available to select Stud & Found personnel.

</p>
<h4>8. OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS</h4><p>

8.1 Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are buyers or sellers on our Site or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers (if any), they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since Stud & Found does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

</p>
<h4>9. SECURITY</h4><p>

9.1 Your Information is stored on Stud & Found’s server located in the United States. We use industry standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet and the user acknowledges this risk.

</p>
<h4>10. NOTICE</h4><p>

10.1 We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure practices. It is your responsibility to regularly check this Privacy Policy and if you are not in agreement with any changes then you should discontinue your membership and not use the Site. All changes to this policy will be effective immediately and any significant policies affecting member’s rights and responsibilities will also be notified to you separately on the Site.</p>
